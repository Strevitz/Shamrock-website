## General info

This frontend application works together with this
[rails application](https://github.com/Strevitz)

## Tech info

- The real estate website was written in **React**. I used **Context API** for better data flow in application.
- In a project, I wanted to learn content flow and how to build simple filter components, apartments details. Also I learned how to use **React-Icons** to style icons directly in React components and **React-Hamburger** plug in.
